# This an example of the Savu code used to reconstruct the DIAD XCT data

# INPUT.nxs is the RAW data .nxs file
# PROCESS_LIST.nxs is the Savu process list that describes the reconstruction process (in folder)
# OUTPUT_DIR specifies where the reconstructed data goes
# OUTPUT_DIR_NAME specifies the directory name where reconstructed data goes
# TMP_DIR specifies a temporary directory for intermediate files


# A modified Savu command to use to reproduce the  obtained result
savu INPUT.nxs PROCESS_LIST.nxs OUTPUT_DIR -f OUTPUT_DIR_NAME -l LOG_DIR
