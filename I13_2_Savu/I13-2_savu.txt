# This is an example of the Savu code used to perform reconstructions for the I13-2 XCT data

# INPUT.nxs is the raw data NeXus file eg. 169068.nxs
# The SAVU_PROCESS_LIST.nxs is the Savu process list used to tell Savu what to do with the raw data eg. scan169068_Savu_Recon.nxs
# OUTPUT_DIR specifies where the reconstructed data goes
# TMP_DIR specifies a temporary directory for intermediate files to go

# Please use the command below to reproduce the obtained results exactly. The -s savu_version flag will set the correct Savu environment for you automatically
