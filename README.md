# XCT-XRDCT Paper Code

This repo stores all of the associated code for the multimodal data descriptor paper found INSERT LINK

The paper describes four resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT) data obtained on the I13-2 beamline, along with XCT data from DIAD, two resolutions of X-Ray Diffraction Computed Tomography data (XRD-CT) from DIAD, and powder X-Ray Diffraction data from the ISIS Neutron & Muon Source Materials Characterisation Lab.

XRD_Analysis_ascii.ipynb shows how to load and visualise the powder-XRD data, showing how the peaks for the Zn and Na phase

A copy of the bash code to execute savu, along with the savu process list is provided for the I13-2 and DIAD XCT entries on Zenodo.

Sinograms.ipynb describes the loading and processing used to plot sinograms for the Zinc and Sodium phases.

DiffTomo_Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook which shows how to perform the reconstruction of the XRD-CT data collected from DIAD.

I13-2_Alignment.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook which shows the process used to align the XCT data across all four resolution obtained on I13-2.

Note: some absolute paths within the notebooks may be incorrect, so double check these with the correct path to the relevant file on your device after downloading the data from Zenodo.
